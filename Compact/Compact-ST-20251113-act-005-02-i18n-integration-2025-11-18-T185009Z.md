# Compact – ST-20251113-act-005-02-i18n-integration

## Confirmed facts
- Introduced a centralized `frontend/src/i18n` module that bootstraps i18next/react-i18next with the existing `frontend/i18n/messages.json`, sets zh as default and en as fallback, and logs missing keys; main.ts now throws localized root-element errors and the bundle depends on `i18next`/`react-i18next`.
- `messages.json` gained the strings needed to drive the UI (delivery labels, pagers, chip placeholders, course metadata, etc.) in both `en` and `zh`, so no component keeps inline literals for primary flows.
- `App`, `FilterPanel`, `CourseList`, `SchedulePreview`, and `TagChip` were refactored to consume `useTranslation`, covering shell alerts, filter controls, chips, empty/error states, pagination, course cards, meeting chips, AM/PM labels, number formatting, and a11y labels; behavior is otherwise unchanged besides now respecting the active locale.
- `CourseList` now formats numbers via `Intl.NumberFormat` based on the active language, and course cards map delivery methods via translation keys rather than a local constant.
- Validation: `npm run build` (TypeScript + Vite) succeeds, so the new dependencies/types compile and the production bundle builds.

## Interface / behavior changes
- UI copy for the core browsing surface now always comes from the locale dictionary; consumers adding new literals must add translation keys first.
- Default locale is zh until a toggle is built; falling back to en if a key is missing, and missing keys raise console warnings via i18next.

## Risks / TODOs
- No runtime language toggle or persistence yet (left for ST-20251113-act-005-03), so end users cannot switch languages without rebuilding.
- Acceptance draft called for lint/CI detection of missing keys; this change only adds console warnings, so automated enforcement remains outstanding.

## Testing
- `npm run build`
