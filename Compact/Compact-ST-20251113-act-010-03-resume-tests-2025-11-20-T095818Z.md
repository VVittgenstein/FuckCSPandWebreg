# Compact – ST-20251113-act-010-03-resume-tests (hotfix)

## Implemented fix
- Hardened checkpoint loading: `loadCheckpointState` now validates that `parsed.campuses` is a mutable object before reuse. Corrupted JSON (e.g., campuses as a string) now falls back to an empty checkpoint with a warning instead of crashing on writes.

## Impact
- Poller resumes cleanly even if `poller_checkpoint.json` is partially corrupted; prevents runtime errors when persisting checkpoints. No other behavior changes.

## Tests
- Not re-run; minimal defensive change only.
