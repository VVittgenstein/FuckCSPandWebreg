# Compact • ST-20251113-act-007-01-entity-design

## Confirmed
- Added `docs/local_data_model.md` describing the full SQLite entity model that backs FR-01/FR-02, including ER diagram plus per-table specs for terms, campuses, subjects, instructors, courses, sections, meetings, populations, cross-listings, status events, subscriptions, open-section snapshots, and the FTS view (lines 1-295).
- Document enumerates SOC→local field mappings that tie each FR filter to concrete columns + transforms, along with derived-field logic for credits, meeting times, delivery mode, and status-event tracking (docs/local_data_model.md:296-338).
- Defined index strategy (`idx_courses_term_subject`, `idx_sections_index_unique`, meeting-time index, etc.) and migration/idempotency guidance to steer upcoming schema/migration tooling tasks (docs/local_data_model.md:316-342).
- Updated `record.json` to mark subtask ST-20251113-act-007-01-entity-design as `done` and refreshed the parent task timestamp to 2025-11-17T02:45:00Z (record.json:230-274).

## Interface / Behavior Changes
- Documentation-only change; no runtime schema or API code altered yet. Future developers should implement migrations exactly as described in `docs/local_data_model.md` to keep downstream consumers aligned.

## Self-test
- Documentation task only; no automated or manual runtime tests executed.

## Risks / TODO
- Schema remains unimplemented in SQL/migration tooling; scripts/migrate_db.* must be built next to realize the documented design.
- Mapping + index plan assumes SOC payload fields remain stable; any upstream API drift will require the doc (and eventual schema) to be revisited.
