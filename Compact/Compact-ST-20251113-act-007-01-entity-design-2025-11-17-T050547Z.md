# Compact • ST-20251113-act-007-01-entity-design

## Confirmed
- `docs/local_data_model.md` still documents the ER design and detailed column mappings/index plans for all course/section/subscription entities that underpin FR-01/FR-02 (`docs/local_data_model.md:1-335`).
- The derived-field guidance now clarifies that ingest should parse `startTimeMilitary`/`endTimeMilitary` directly whenever available (since many SOC rows omit `pmCode`), and only fall back to the 12h clock—with the previously added 12 AM/PM safeguards—when military values are absent (`docs/local_data_model.md:333`).
- No schema code changes were required; documentation continues to be the single source of truth for the upcoming migration tooling.

## Interface / Behavior Changes
- Ingest logic expectations are updated: parsers must prefer the military-time fields to avoid discarding afternoon/evening slots lacking `pmCode`, ensuring FR-02 time filters remain accurate.

## Self-test
- Documentation update only; no automated/manual tests executed.

## Risks / TODO
- SQLite schema + migration tooling remain unimplemented and must honor these parsing rules when built.
- Future SOC payload shifts (e.g., removal of `pmCode` or format changes) will require revisiting the ingest guidance.
